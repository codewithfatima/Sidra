            At we will provide support in a caring, organized and disciplined manner,
            encouraging each student to reach their full potential. Every child will have an equal
            opportunity to learn. We aim to promote amongst our students, the understanding and
            tolerance of any differences in ability, race or culture...
            <br /><br />
            Our curriculum and school philosophy aim to encourage full participation by all
            students. We believe that the promotion of a partnership between students, teachers,
            administration and parents will enable each individual to become a valued member of the
            school and the wider community.
